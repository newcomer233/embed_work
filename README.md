for UoG Team 27 embed work

This project and its source code are part of the coursework for ENG5220: Real-Time Embedded Programming (2024–25) at the University of Glasgow.
Until the project is officially completed, in principle, the code is not available for use outside UoG Team 27.

PS: Honestly, would anyone even want code from students like us at the bottom of the food chain?
Even feeding it to an AI might get a "meh, too noob" response (tears).

PPS: On second thought... maybe we should feed it to an AI—to help spot AI's bugs! Haha.
