This project and its source code are part of the coursework for ENG5220: Real-Time Embedded Programming (2024–25) at the University of Glasgow.
Until the project is officially completed, in principle, the code is not available for use outside UoG Team 27.

PS: Honestly, would anyone even want code from students like us at the bottom of the food chain?
Even feeding it to an AI might get a "meh, too noob" response (tears).

PPS: On second thought... maybe we should feed it to an AI—to help spot AI's bugs! Haha.

I finally know why told us don't use GPT4..when translate PPS sentence to English "maybe we should feed it to an AI—to help spot bugs!"  emmmm, AI still know nothing about humans thinking.



We utilize the following open-source projects in our system:

VOSK - A lightweight and accurate offline speech recognition toolkit.

Piper - A fast and high-quality neural text-to-speech (TTS) system optimized for local execution, especially on embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi.
  https://github.com/rhasspy/piper

These components enable our system to perform real-time, local speech recognition and synthesis without relying on cloud services.
