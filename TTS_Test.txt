Decide to train a voice for TTS. First, collect a high-quality speech database to be used as training data. Then Search for livestream videos online and extracted audio files. After that Preprocess the audio by removing silent segments and parts not spoken by the target streamer. In the end, separate the audio and save as individual files, extract subtitles and match with the audio, generate training data.
In the preprocessing, the human voices could not be distinguished clearly. To solve the problem, first change the learning rate and then select another more longer voice as model.
The accuracy of the model is not good so that in the final audio files, some sentences could not be distinguished well even some words are recognized as another kind of language.Finally Some parts of the audio files are not good. And in several parts the voice of another people is recorded

Use Vits model to train in Windows system with python firstly and then port it to the Raspberry Pi using C++.
The text annotations do not match the actual content of the audio, causing the model to learn incorrect mapping relationships. This affects the training effect and makes it difficult to improve the model's recognition accuracy.In the end, The voice generated was not as expected, so we want to use another methods

Explored existing open-source TTS frameworks and voice models.Change to another method. Compared Piper, XTTS-v2, and VITS And chose Piper for its ONNX inference support and native C++ compatibility.Piper meets the requirements for lightweight, fast, and offline deployment

We just use C++ to finish our work. First clone the codes of Piper on Github.And  just compile Piper official C++ inference program.Download the voice model first  and run the test file. What’s more remove the Python part of the code. In this process, espeak-ng-data could not work. A symbolic link is created so that the piper program can find the relevant files at the expected path. The output audio is natural and clear sound which meets our requests
