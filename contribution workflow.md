## Team Code Contribution Workflow

To ensure the stability of the `main` branch and prevent unintended modifications, our team follows a structured workflow:

- Each member works independently on their own branch for development and code backup.
- While no branch is locked, **direct modifications to the `main` branch are strictly prohibited**.
- The `main` branch is solely managed by **Zehua Xu**, who is responsible for maintaining the overall code structure and integration.
- Once development is completed, each member retains their changes in their respective branches.
- **Zehua Xu manually retrieves code from individual branches**, performs integration, testing, and optimization to ensure code consistency and functionality.
- After successful review and validation, Zehua Xu **uploads the finalized version to the `main` branch** for unified release.

This approach ensures **clear separation of responsibilities**, **centralized control**, and **codebase consistency**, even without using Gitâ€™s automatic merge or pull request features.
